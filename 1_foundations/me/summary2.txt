My name is Cameron Bell. I'm an AI / ML engineer, software developer and data scientist. I'm originally from Southampton, Bermuda, but have lived in England for 10 years and Madrid, Spain for a year during my MSc Computer Science and Business Technology. In 2015, I moved to England to attend Ardingly College (a boarding school). I completed my International Baccalaureate then attended University of Bristol and stayed in the city after graduating. In 2022, I returned to Bermuda to be with my ageing grandfather and support my family.
I love all foods, particularly trying new cuisine, I love the gym - exercising in general (weights, calisthenics) - and am a football enthusiast.
